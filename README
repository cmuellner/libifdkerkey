IFDHandler for the ST Kerkey
============================

This library contains an IFD handler for PCSC lite [1],
which allows to access the Kerkey via the PCSC lite daemon.

The library uses two Linux kernel interfaces to interact
with the ST Kerkey:

 * I2C dev ([2]) for data exchange
 * GPIO sysfs aka. gpiolib ([3]) for resetting the device

Usage
=====

To use this IFDHandler one needs to specify the reader
in the reader configuration directory of PCSC lite.
To do so one has to create a file which specifies the
communication parameters.

Below is an example how this specification could look like:

cat /etc/reader.conf.d/libifdkerkey
# ST Kerkey with I2C communication
#  - N is the I2C bus
#  - CS is the I2C device address
#  - GPIOCHIP is the reset pin chip
#  - GPIOLINE is the reset pin line (prefix with 'n' for active low)
#  - name is the reader name (may be ommitted)
#    Possible reader names are: 
#     Kerkey (default value)
# example: /dev/i2c-3:0x20:1:n16
#DEVICENAME        /dev/i2c-N:CS:GPIOCHIP:GPIOLINE[:name]
#FRIENDLYNAME      "ST Kerkey (I2C)"
#LIBPATH           /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/i2c/libifdkerkey.so
