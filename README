IFDHandler for the ST Kerkey
============================

This library contains an IFD handler for PCSC lite [1],
which allows to access the ST Kerkey or devices with similar
protocol (e.g. STSAFE) via the PCSC lite daemon.

The library uses two Linux kernel interfaces to interact
with the ST Kerkey:

 * I2C dev ([2]) for data exchange
 * GPIO sysfs API ([3]) or character device API ([4]) optional reset control

Building
========

To build the library simply use this command:

  make

Cross-compilation is supported by setting the CROSS_COMPILE environment
variable.

Installation
============

To install the library you can copy the built library to a location
of your choice. E.g.:

  sudo cp src/libifdkerkey.so /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/i2c/libifdkerkey.so

Integration and configuration
=============================

The integration of the IFDHandler library in PCSC lite
can be achieved by storing configuration files in
the reader configuration directory
(typically /etc/reader.conf.d).

Details about the PCSC lite configuration file
syntax can be found in the corresponding man page
(man 5 reader.conf).

Besides the PCSC lite integration, the configuration
file also provides parameters to libifdkerkey, that
set the communication properties (I2C and GPIO settings).

Details about the libifdkerkey specific configuration
can be found in the file libifdkerkey.
A good approach is to copy that into
/etc/reader.conf.d/ and edit as needed:

  sudo cp libifdkerkey /etc/reader.conf.d/

After changing the configuration file a restart
of PCSC lite is required:

  sudo systemctl restart pcscd

Debugging
=========

In case of issues the following commands can help
to isolate the problem.

Checking the status of PCSC lite:

  systemctl status pcscd

Checking if the reader has been found:

  pcsc_scan

Checking logs (continuously):

  journalctl -f
