# Configuration file to interact with the ST Kerkey

# FRIENDLYNAME defines the name that's used as reader name
FRIENDLYNAME      "ST STSAFE-J100 (I2C)"

# DEVICENAME defines the communication parameters
# The following forms are possible
# 1) No reset line
#   /dev/i2c-N:CS
# 2) Reset line controlled via Linux gpiochip API
#   /dev/i2c-N:CS:GPIOCHIP:GPIOLINE
# 3) Reset line controlled via Linux sysfs API
#   /dev/i2c-N:CS:GPIO
#
#  - N is the I2C bus
#  - CS is the I2C device address
#  - GPIOCHIP is the reset pin chip
#  - GPIOLINE is the reset pin line (prefix with 'n' for active low)
#  - GPIO is the reset pin GPIO number (prefix with 'n' for active low)
#
# Examples:
# DEVICENAME      /dev/i2c-3:0x20
# DEVICENAME      /dev/i2c-3:0x20:1:n16
# DEVICENAME      /dev/i2c-3:0x20:16
